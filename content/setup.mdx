# Rules Setup

This guide explains how to configure **repository custom instructions** for GitHub Copilot and how to create **rules** in Cursor. These systems let you provide AI coding assistants with persistent, context-specific guidance—making their responses more aligned with your team's workflows, coding standards, and preferences.

## GitHub Copilot: Repository Custom Instructions

GitHub Copilot supports repository-level custom instructions, allowing you to encode preferences, workflows, or important context into a Markdown file. This information is automatically included in Copilot Chat and when Copilot is assigned to issues or pull requests.

**Official documentation:**  
[Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Create the Instructions File**
   - In the root of your repository, create a file named `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
   - If the `.github` directory does not exist, create it first.

2. **Write Your Instructions**
   - Use short, clear, and self-contained statements.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     Always use React 18 and Material-UI v5 for frontend code.
     Integrate with CMS MX APIs when backend functionality is required.
     Follow our repository's code style as defined in styleguide.md.
     ```
   - Instructions are written in Markdown. Whitespace and line breaks are ignored, so write for readability.

3. **Save and Commit**
   - Commit and push the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to your repository.

4. **Usage**
   - Copilot will automatically include these instructions in chat interactions, pull requests, and issue assignments related to the repository.
   - In Copilot Chat (in VS Code, Visual Studio, or GitHub web), you can see if the instructions are being applied by checking the References list.

5. **Manage or Update**
   - Edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at any time to update or refine your rules.

**Tips:**
- Keep instructions concise and relevant to your project.
- Avoid conflicting guidance.
- See more examples and details in the [official Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=vscode).

## Cursor: Project and User Rules

Cursor uses a “rules” system to provide persistent, reusable context for the Agent and Cmd-K AI. Rules can encode coding conventions, automate workflows, or establish response preferences.

**Official documentation:**  
[Cursor - Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)

### Types of Rules

<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-4">
	<Card>
		<CardContent className="flex flex-col gap-4">
			<FolderTree className="shrink-0"/>
			<div>
				<CardTitle>Project Rules</CardTitle>
				<CardDescription>
					Stored in `.cursor/rules`, version-controlled and scoped to your codebase.
				</CardDescription>
			</div>
		</CardContent>
	</Card>
	<Card>
		<CardContent className="flex flex-col gap-4">
			<UserRound className="shrink-0"/>
			<div>
				<CardTitle>User Rules</CardTitle>
				<CardDescription>
					Global to your Cursor environment. Defined in settings and always applied.
				</CardDescription>
			</div>
		</CardContent>
	</Card>
	<Card>
		<CardContent className="flex flex-col gap-4">
			<History className="shrink-0"/>
			<div>
				<CardTitle>`.cursorrules` (Legacy)</CardTitle>
				<CardDescription>
					Still supported, but deprecated. Use Project Rules instead.
				</CardDescription>
			</div>
		</CardContent>
	</Card>
</div>

### How to Set Up Project Rules

1. **Create a Rule File**
   - In your project, create a `.cursor/rules` directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Use Cursor's “New Cursor Rule” command, or manually create a `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules`.

2. **Write Rule Content**
   - Rules are written in MDC (Markdown with metadata).
   - Example:
     ```md
     ---
     description: Use React 18, MUI 5, and CMS MX
     globs:
     alwaysApply: true
     ---
     - Always use React 18 syntax and features for all frontend components.
     - Use MUI 5 for all UI elements.
     - Integrate with CMS MX for backend data and APIs.
     ```
   - Reference files or templates with `@filename.tsx` as needed.

3. **Organize Nested Rules (Optional)**
   - Place `.cursor/rules` directories in subfolders for component- or domain-specific guidance.

4. **Using and Managing Rules**
   - Rules are automatically attached when relevant files are referenced.
   - You can invoke or apply rules manually in chat using `@ruleName`.
   - View and manage rules from Cursor Settings > Rules.

5. **Best Practices**
   - Keep rules actionable and focused (under 500 lines recommended).
   - Split large concepts into multiple, composable rules.
   - Provide examples or referenced files when helpful.
